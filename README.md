This repo includes:
Script run_analysis.R
File tidy_data.txt
The code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that you performed to clean up the data called CodeBook.md

run_analysis.R does the following:
Loads data from the UCI HAR Dataset
Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
Labels the data set with variable names from file features.txt
Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
Creates tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
Loads tidy data set to txt file tidy_data.txt

In order to run run_analysis.R correctly you should do the following
unpack UCI HAR Dataset in directory called "UCI HAR Dataset"
Set "UCI HAR Dataset" directory as working directory in R
Have installed and loaded library "reshape2"

Tidy_data.txt is the tidy dataset generated by run_analysis script. 

CodeBook.md
The CodeBook.md file explains the transformations performed and the resulting data and variables.
